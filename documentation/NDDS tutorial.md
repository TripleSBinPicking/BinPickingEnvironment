# NDDS tutorial

By following the original tutorial found [here](https://github.com/TripleSBinPicking/bin_picking_environment/blob/master/documentation/resources/NDDS.pdf), most things will be explained. In this file there will be some addendums to the tutorial for points that are not clear or things that are unnecessary.

### Installation
In step 1, the original writers want you to get the file via github lfs, but this does not work at the time. So for an alternative we provide a compressed version of the code [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Dataset_Synthesizer/releases/download/1.2.2/ndds_1.2.2.zip).

### Starting NDDS
To start NDDS just open the NDDS.uproject file that is in the \Source directory of the NDDS folder.
